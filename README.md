# Tealium TagBridge Integrations

TagBridge Integrations allow for 3rd party vendor libraries (SDKs) to work with Tealium's services.

## What is TagBridge ?

The TagBridge feature is the ability within the Tealium iOS and Android native libraries to trigger remote code commands from events definied in a TIQ (Tealium's dashboard) extension or load rule. Only the execution and passing of payload data can be configured remotely from TIQ, the actual code to be executed must be added prior to compile time, which allows for both flexibility and security. As such, several pre-defined integrations have been included under respective folders.  Note that these integrations require both a Tealium native library and the 3rd party library to be added to the target application to work.
